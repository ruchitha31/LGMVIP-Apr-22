Task 1 - Iris Flowers Classification ML Project
This particular ML project is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning. The iris flowers dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 4 features, ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, ‘Petal length’, ‘Petal width’. Since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities. The aim of this project is to predict type of flowers based on features.
